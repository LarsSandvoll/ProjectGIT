This is a case study with focus on determine safety stocks in a distribution system. In the system 
there is one central warehouse and 21 local warehouses. The central warehouse has a supplier, 
while the local warehouses sees the demand. The case study uses data for monthly demands from 
each local warehouse to compute the predicted demand and variance. There is only data from one 
year, so it is assumed to follow normal distribution for simplicity. There is also not enough data to 
use any more intellectual forecasting method. To compute the base stock levels the guaranteed 
service safety stock location for tree networks approached were used, which is an extension of the 
‘Simpson’ approach.
